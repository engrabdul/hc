HouseCare Saudi Arabia — Welcome Reward landing page and assets.

## What

This repository contains a single-page landing site (`index.html`) and assets (favicon/image) used for the HouseCare welcome reward experience.

## Files

- `index.html` — main landing page.
- `hclogo.jpg` — logo used in the page (and favicon reference in `index.html`).
- `.gitignore` — ignore rules for common web project artifacts.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser locally or serve from any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

To preview locally using a simple Python server:

```powershell
# From repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Next steps

- Add a `LICENSE` if you want an explicit license.
- Add GitHub Pages in repo settings to serve the site from `main`.
- Add a `README` section for deployment or CI if you'd like help setting those up.
